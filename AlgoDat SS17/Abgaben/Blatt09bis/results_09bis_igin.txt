Our test could not be run on your code. This usually means there is something broken in your code.
To fix this issue please check the following points:


- Your code should never be in any package. Remove all lines "package XXX;" from you submission.
- You should not use any non-standard imports. Check the Beginning of your files for lines "import XXX" and remove them if they're not part of the Vorgabe.
- You should never use System.exit(0) or similar in your code.
- You should never change the function headers of the Vorgabe in your submission. 
- Your code should compile. If you see any red x in Eclipse, please fix these problems before submitting.
- Do not use any german Umlaut characters in variable names or output strings (best not to use them anywhere)

If you checked all these points and there is still an issue please write a mail to algodatwms@robotics.tu-berlin.de and tell us your tubit username.
